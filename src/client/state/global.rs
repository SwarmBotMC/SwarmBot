    /// # Goal
    /// we want to assign regions to explore for each bot
    /// we want to explore in rings
    ///
    /// ```
    /// 33333
    /// 32223
    /// 32123
    /// 32223
    /// 33333
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Think of this as a priority queue where low numbers have a higher
    /// priority. It is easy to connect all regions because the chunks
    /// loaded are in a square in Minecraft and not a circle. Therefore, we can
    /// make sure sections will not collide.
    ///
    /// # Assignment
    /// ## Initial
    /// Initially, this will just be a priority queue. All bots will get
    /// assigned a slot and walk to it
    ///
    /// ## Next Step
    /// A na√Øve approach would be always taking the region with the least
    /// priority and breaking ties with distance. However, assume a bot is
    /// at an x and the last remaining region at the tie-breaking priority is an
    /// o ```
    /// ..x
    /// ...
    /// o..
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// This would be a long traversal. In addition, assume  this was a thousand
    /// blocks away. This would take a lot of extra time. Ideally we would
    /// have a bot that will finish the task in a little period of time go to
    /// it. Instead we will have bots choose the smallest priority adjacent to
    /// it else if there are no adj the closest next smallest. Let's see how
    /// this would play out
    /// ```
    /// 4321.
    /// 5..0.
    /// 6....
    /// 78...
    /// 9....
    /// ```
    /// or equally likely
    /// ```
    /// ...12
    /// ...03
    /// 3...4
    /// 12..5
    /// 09876
    /// ```
    /// ## Data structure
    /// We want to make it easy for bots to follow the graph. Let us denote each
    /// grid as `(x,y)`, where the priority is `max(abs(x),abs(y))`
    /// ```
    /// (-1, 1)(0, 1)(1, 1)(-1, 0)(0, 0)(1, 0)(-1, -1)(0, -1)(1, -1)
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// We _could_ use a [`std::collections::hash::HashSet`] with an i32 tuple,
    /// but we could also use a wrapping structure
    /// ```
    /// 123
    /// 804
    /// 765
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// We will use a HashMap for now though since it is simpler
    /// the lengths are 1, (3*3 - prev) = 8, (5*5) - prev = 17.
    /// There is a clock-wise wrapping where the top left is the first element.
